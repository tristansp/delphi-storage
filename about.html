<p>The Delphi patient information system is quick and easy way for first responders to acess vital information. Our system is easy, a user goes onto our webstie and enters their vital medical information, we compile that information into a QR code. This is engraved onto a bracelet which is then sent back to the user. The bracelet is used whenever necessary and wherever it is safe.</p>
