			<h3 class="heading">How We Started</h3>
			<p id="aboutus-paragraph">When a teacher at Khan Lab School gave his students the assignment to create a company or service that somehow improves the world, thus, Project: Delphi was born. High school students Tristan Perry, Timothy Chien, Vivek Punn, Shira Sheppard, and Aryan Prodduturi all felt passionate about improving healthcare in emergency situations. After months of improvement, brainstorming, and prototyping, they came up with the Delphi Information Bracelet.</p>

			<p class="values">Safety - Safety is important because when it comes to medicine, keeping people safe is all that matters. Project: Dephi values safety over everything. <br><br> Health - Health was one of Project: Delphi's original values. Probably being the most interesting and important of their values, health has guided this team into the right direction. <br><br> Security - Security has become one of the more pertinant values of the team. We are dealing with people's medical information so security is paramount. <br><br> Efficiency - We value efficiency because when it comes to medical processes, each second can mean the difference between life and death. </p>
